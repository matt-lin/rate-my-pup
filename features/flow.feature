Feature: Improve "flow" of site

    As a user
    So I can have a more positive experience on the RateMyPup webpage
    I want to be able to intuitively interact with the site

  Background: breeders have been added to the database
    Given the following breeders exist:
      | name            | city     | state  |
      | Carl            | Berkeley | CA     |
      | Chris           | Berkeley | CA     |
      | Alex            | Richmond | CA     |
      | Alexander       | New York | NY     |
      | Michael Jackson | Boston   | MA     |
      | George Michael  | Fresno   | CA     |
      | George W. Bush  | Waco     | TX     |
    And I am on the RateMyPup home page

    Scenario: The hashtags should be present on the page
      Given I am logged in
      And I am on the "Create New Pup Test" page
      And I should see all of:
        | "#EasyToObedienceTrain"                     |
        | "#HardToObedienceTrain"                     |
        | "#EasyToHouseTrain"                         |
